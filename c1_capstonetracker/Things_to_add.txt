Important Things to Add:
  *The ability to edit users.
    We started on that functionality but ran out of time. But we think that the user should be able to edit their own profile.
    They should have the ability to change their personal attributes and update them as they please.
  *The ability to remove users.
    The admins should be able to remove whole rows from the lists and also be able to edit them.
  *Automatic password, and changing passwords:
    When a user is created there should be a password created for them instead of the admin entering this password.
    this should be emailed to the email address given when creating the user. and when the user logs in they should be able to change their password.
  *Chatting ability
    Having some sort of chat, or messenger system that enables employees and students to leave messages or chat with each other.
